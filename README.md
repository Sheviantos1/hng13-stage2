# HNGx Stage 2 — Blue-Green Deployment

This project demonstrates a blue-green deployment architecture using Docker Compose and NGINX. It runs two identical application containers (`blue` and `green`) and routes traffic based on the active pool defined in environment variables.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sheviantos1/hng13-stage2.git
   cd hng13-stage2

# HNGx Stage 2 — Blue-Green Deployment

This project demonstrates a blue-green deployment architecture using Docker Compose and NGINX. It runs two identical application containers (`blue` and `green`) and routes traffic based on the active pool defined in environment variables.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

   cd hng13-stage2


- Create your .env file:
cp .env.example .env
- Start the containers:
docker-compose up -d


- Access the app:
- Main endpoint: http://localhost:8080
- Blue service: http://localhost:8081
- Green service: http://localhost:8082
🔁 Failover Testing
To simulate failure and test NGINX failover:
curl http://localhost:8081/chaos/start


Then access http://localhost:8080 again to confirm traffic reroutes to the backup pool.
